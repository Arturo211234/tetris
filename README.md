# tetris
A small little implementation of tetris. Right now, only the back-end is mostly done. Also, the code is filled with testing code, which in the future will be removed :^))

# Building
I see no reason why you'd want to build this as it is right now, but if you really want to, then follow these steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/aslikr42069/tetris.git
cd tetris
make
```
